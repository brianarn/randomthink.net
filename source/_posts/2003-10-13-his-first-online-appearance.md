Lisa e-mailed me this picture – she took a half day to spend time with the family. It’s a picture of her holding Isaac.

As she put it in the e-mail, “Here he is! My first nephew, the first installment in the next generation of our family.” Born October 11th at 11:47pm, weighing in at 7 pounds, 6 ounces.
