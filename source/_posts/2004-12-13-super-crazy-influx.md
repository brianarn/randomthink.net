So, there’s this awesome [iPod Mini][1] ad that’s floating around the ‘net. I initially found the video through [this link][2], which I saw on [AppleGeeks][3]. At the page, it had the video, as well as a note that due to the linkage from AG, his bandwidth had been slammed. I have no bandwidth cap, so I offered to mirror it for him.

Talk about an amazing response.

In fact, this video has gotten so much buzz there’s even a [Wired article][4] about it now. I don’t know if it’s that article that’s doing it, or if it’s maybe just the buzz is really taking off now, but today has been huge for the video. I looked at my stats this morning, and I’d had 5099 requests for it this month. As I started writing this post, it’s at 6377, with over 15GB (yes, gigabytes) of bandwidth consumed just today. Refreshing those stats (roughly five minutes later) shows 6433 requests for the video. That’s amazing and awesome growth.

In a way, I feel a little connection to this video. I hope that my mirroring it has helped this guy take off. Maybe great things will be coming his way now. I hope Apple takes note and provides him with a free iPod Mini or a job in marketing or something.
