GameSpy has a great preview article up about an expansion to be coming out for SimCity 4, titled “Rush Hour.” I guess this means I should probably try and play SimCity 4 some more, as right now I’ve not played it too much. I really enjoy the game, don’t get me wrong – it’s just rather difficult, and I haven’t had the time I’d like to be able to invest in the game. Anyways, here’s the link to the article, which is well worth the read if you’re a SimCity fan.
