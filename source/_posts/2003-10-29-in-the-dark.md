So, I thought that my grandma was doing well. I thought that they were just keeping her in the hospital until the pneumonia goes away. Then I get an IM from my cousin Hillary who tells me that my grandma’s surgery went well and that they got the feeding tube in. Surgery? Feeding tube? What?

Ugh. I can’t even reach my mom by phone, I have no idea what’s going on, and it makes my stomach a bit upset. I’m feeling left in the dark, and it’s an awful feeling.
