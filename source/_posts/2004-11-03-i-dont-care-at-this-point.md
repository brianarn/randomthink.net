Just a note. I don’t really feel like discussing politics. I haven’t before, I don’t really care to now, especially after everything this year so far. I’m sick of it. I’m ready to move on with my life. I suggest you do the same.

Bush won. Whether that makes you happy or sad, there’s not a single thing you can do about it. It’s time for us to move on. It’s over. Work on being positive and finding good things that will come of it. If you can’t find any, I don’t want to hear it, because your complaining does nothing to help.
