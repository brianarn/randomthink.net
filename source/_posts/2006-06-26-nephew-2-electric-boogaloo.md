I had planned on posting some Vegas updates tonight, but we had a bit of an early arrival tonight.

My sister-in-law had her second son tonight at 7:22pm, weighing in at seven pounds and one ounce, and twenty inches tall. He’s a little bit less than my nephew Isaac was, as he had five ounces and two inches on this one. He is around two weeks early, but he’s certainly not premature. He’s very well developed and doing excellently for having been alive less than five hours.

Her water broke at around 8:00am, and the day was fairly uneventful after that. Around 7:15pm, they came in to check on her, so we left the room for a minute, only to be quickly called back in, as he wasn’t just starting to poke out, but his whole head was pretty much already out. One push and the kid practically somersaulted out. It’s taken longer to type this paragraph out than it did for her to push him out, which is quite amusing. Eleven hours of build-up for about eleven seconds of push, and she was done. After that he proceeded to pee all over. It was very amusing for all involved. I was not peed upon, for which I am grateful.

As soon as I have approval, I’ll be getting a picture or two up on here. He’s so cute and tiny and it’s so neat to see. Excitement abounds!
