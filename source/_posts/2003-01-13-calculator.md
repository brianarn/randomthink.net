[![VB vs Built-in][2]][2]

Kind of a big image, but oh well. I’m working on a calculator for a project in a VB class. The one on the left is my Calc, the one on the right is Windows’ Calc. Neato! For Windows-specific project, I must admit that I like VB. It’s pretty easy to use and I can whip up applications really quickly.
