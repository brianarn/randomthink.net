So, I’m sitting at Sky Harbor in Phoenix, and using this interesting ‘net terminal to do this entry. I have about 2:30+ minutes left, because I just couldn’t help myself.

You pay a buck, and get four minutes, with each addition minute costing $0.25. I have to say, this is a very neat idea. The only frustrating thing is that I’m actually kneeling in front of it in order to reach the keyboard.

My mom and I are en route to Iowa – we’re about to board, I just couldn’t help but check this thing out. I doubt I’ll get a chance to make another entry, so this counts as my journal from the road. I have to say, once again, that this is a very neat technology.
