[BBC News: Pub chef bitten by deadly spider][1]

This story is great – basically, a chef was bitten by a deadly spider, and he took a camphone picture of it right away, and it helped the doctors to identify what spider bit him, so he was treated more quickly. That’s too awesome.

I’m glad I carry my camphone with me. Maybe it’ll save *my* life someday.
