Earlier today, my friend [Andrew][1] tweeted the following:

Doing some quick Googling, I’m sure it’s not exactly the most original quote  
ever, but it’s one that really resonated with me. It made me think about what  
I’m working on doing with my next [Ignite NM][3] talk, which I titled “Doing  
what you love: Making a hobby into a career”.

I owe a good deal to Andrew and a bit to dumb luck, but in a way, I’m doing  
what I am these days not because I went and made my own way, so much as I made  
myself ready for when the opportunities presented themselves.

In my case, I wanted to work on JavaScript full-time. I could have gone and  
become a contractor or consultant or something, but instead, I polished my  
skills. I worked on improving. I read and studied. I spent free time  
experimenting. I created the conditions for success such that when the  
opportunity presented itself, I was ready for it, and I couldn’t be happier.

Are you doing what you love? If you aren’t, why not?
