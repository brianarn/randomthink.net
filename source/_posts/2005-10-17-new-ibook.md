Isn’t it cute?

![Brian's new iBook][1]

On Friday, I finally managed to win Lisa over and convince her that an iBook would be a good thing. I honestly believe that it will be. It already has been. It’s got all of the Unix utilities and whatnot that I want on a daily basis, as well as support for iTunes and my iPod. I’ve already spent several hours on it, from recreational activities to software development for educational purposes, and everything has been great.

I’ve been a fan of OS X for some time now, but really, only peripherally. I’d used it a time or two in a computer lab, but hadn’t really had any detailed experience with it. When I bought it, I got this fast rush of buyer’s remorse, since I dropped a lot of money into a machine that ran an OS that I wasn’t familiar with.

Within moments from boot, my remorse was pretty much gone. My experience has been nothing but top-notch. So far, the adjustments have been minor things such as:

*   Most of the time, where I used the control key in Windows, I’d now use the command key. For example, Ctrl+T for a new tab in Firefox in Windows, but Cmd+T in OS X. Ctrl+W to close the tab becomes Cmd+W, etc etc.
*   Click-hold works to get a menu on some things, but not all. Control-clicking tends to get a menu in the places where click-hold does not.
*   In most cases where I’d need a right-click, doing a command-click works. Really, this is primarily applicable to World of Warcraft, as a right-click was how I’d activate pretty much everything from items to mailboxes, and now it’s a command-click unless I’ve got a multibutton mouse hooked up.
*   Closing a window does not mean the program has shut down. I’ve just closed the window. Using command+q shuts down the program, not just the window. This particular functionality is pretty neat in some ways, as I can have Firefox running and ready to go but with no open windows, and I can just pop a window open when I need it.

Really, that’s all I can think of off of the top of my head. I’ve adapted quickly to using two fingers on the trackpad to scroll all over, and to using Dashboard and ExposÃ© to show me nifty widgets as well as my open windows. I’m really quite enjoying it.

For those curious as to what I got specifically, it’s the 12″ iBook as it comes by default. It’s got a 1.33GHz G4 processor, 512MB of RAM, running OS X version 10.4.2. It has a DVD/CD-RW and a 40GB hard drive. I had someone recommend to me that I go with the base system, because it’s a lot cheaper to upgrade afterwards, rather than have Apple do it all for you. For another $300 I could have gone to the 14″ screen with 20GB more of disk and a DVD burner, but I didn’t really need all of that. I preferred the smaller screen, and have no need for DVD burning on the go, so I’d have been paying $300 for another 20GB and a less convenient size. I’d rather put the money into RAM and a nice big external Firewire hard drive, and maybe a bluetooth mouse and keyboard.

If any of you out there are Mac fanatics, I’d really love to hear any software recommendations that you have. I’ve put Firefox and Thunderbird on there already, as well as World of Warcraft, the GIMP, Audacity, and some other useful things. Safari and Mail are okay applications, but I prefer Firefox and Thunderbird for web/mail purposes. I’ve heard that Growl is a neat and useful application, as well as Quicksilver. Also, if you have any recommendations for neat hardware or accessories for it, I’d appreciate those too. Any thoughts?
