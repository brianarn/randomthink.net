Seeing as [Mark][1] just recently posted about [his beard][2], it reminds me that I said I’d talk about mine, so here goes.

A couple of weeks ago, I had posted that [I has a beard][3], wherein I said that I suspected that I’d have the beard for a while, or that I’d get drunk and shave it off. I’d hoped someone would find mild amusement in the concept of me being drunk (something that has yet to happen, and quite possibly never will, and that’s okay), but nobody really said anything. Oh well.

Fast forward a couple of weeks, and I was getting frustrated. For as many compliments as I was getting, and as much as others liked it, I had to be honest with myself and say that, y’know, I just really don’t like it on me. A beard is not for me. Even after I found [beards.org][4] and got all that great advice, it just wasn’t for me.

So, on March 18th, I shaved the beard.

I didn’t go crazy like Mark. For as much as I didn’t like the beard, I love the goatee. I started it roughly a week before my second nephew was born, and it hasn’t been shaved off since. I have no plans of it going away any time soon, and this time I mean it.
