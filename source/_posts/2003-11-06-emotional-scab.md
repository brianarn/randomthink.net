I got a good, long sleep last night. It was great to rest so well, especially after such an emotionally and physically draining day. I woke up, and a bit of an emotional scab was in place. It still hurts, but if I don’t think about it too much yet, I do okay. If I think about it a lot, it’s like picking at a scab. It starts out with just a curious thought, but then you get more and more into it and it winds up leading to serious pain and more time for healing. I’ve not picked at it too much today, but I feel like I’ll be picking at it bit by bit for the next few weeks/months. it’s hard, but we’re doing okay, and we’re doing our best to move on.

Okay, gotta get back to work.
