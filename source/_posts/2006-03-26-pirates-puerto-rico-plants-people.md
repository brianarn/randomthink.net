Everyone left about half an hour ago, and I just got finished cleaning the kitchen, so I figured I’d put up a quick post before bed.

Tonight was a gaming night. I posted a quick photo to Flickr before things started, with a display of games that could potentially be played tonight.

Clockwise from upper left: Puerto Rico, Carcassonne (with Pit on top of it), Betrayal at House on the Hill, Pirate’s Cove, Settlers of Catan (with Cities & Knights under it), Set and Munchkin (with Munchkin Bites under it).

Anthony and his brother Matthew got here around 3:00pm or so, I think. Well, maybe more like 3:20 or something. I knew they’d be early and that was okay.

First run: 3-man Pirate’s Cove. It was a first for all of us, so there was some requisite “How does this rule read? How does this card play?”. It was quite the fun game, absolutely oozing with flavor. Lots of pirate references, famous pirates involved (I defeated Captain Hook in this round), and at the end, Matt and I were tied with 36 points each, so we had one last grand battle to determine winner. I won, and it was most glorious. Matthew (who I believe is 16) was nicknamed Nobeard.

Thoughts on Pirate’s Cove: It’s very luck heavy, with lots of dice rolls and random encounters with other players. It worked decently well as three players, and was still quite fun. I was actually worried at first, after having read the rules, that it’d be a bit boring. It didn’t disappoint and was quite entertaining.

Second game: Puerto Rico. Started at around 4:50pm, finished at around 6:50ish. Again, just the three of us still, and a first for all of us. It was quite daunting at first – so many pieces and a very particular board layout – but once we got going with it, it was really quite fun. It has a lot of Settlers of Catan-like elements, but with much less luck.

Thoughts on Puerto Rico: The copy we were playing with tonight belongs to Anthony. I NEED MY OWN. It was great. The setup was more tedious than Settlers of Catan, amazingly, but it still worked out quite well. I can see why it’s supposed to be 3+ players though, because there are two of most buildings and that would potentially be quite boring.

At this point, we broke for dinner. James and his girlfriend showed up at this point, and joined us for food. Lisa made a Walgreens run, because she wasn’t pleased with my snack choices. She came back with lots of sugar, which I can still feel coarsing through me.

I kind of lost track of time at this point, but there were five of us (Lisa was running Uldaman in WoW) to play, so we started up another round of Pirate’s Cove. Let me tell you, this game gets a lot more entertaining with the full five players. We’d have battles of four ships all going at it at once, and the ending scores were much more spread out, and overally generally higher. About 25% through the rounds (12 rounds, no more no less), my friend Jason shows up, so I relinquish my pieces and such to him, and stand up and become proctor, which is a role that I generally enjoy, what with my urge to control stuff. James thought it’d be witty to start calling me the proctologist at that point.

After Pirate’s Cove wrapped, we started up some Betrayal at House on the Hill, since it was a good six player game and would wrap (in theory) within an hour. It went from around 10:50 or so until 12:15am, at which point Jason got a call to come home, so he left and Matt took control of his character. We were nearing endgame, so it worked out okay. My character turned into the traitor and had control of lethal tentacle plants, but they got the plant killing spray really fast and I was defeated pretty quickly, around 12:45 or so.

However, at about 12:30 or so, James got a phone call. A friend of sorts from the Racing Southwest forums was killed on his motorcycle on Alameda Blvd. just minutes beforehand. The game was just about over at that point, so being an RSW admin, James sits down at my Mac and puts a post up on the boards so inform people of this guy’s passing.

As you can imagine, that generally saps the pleasure out of the room for awhile while it kind of sinks in. I mean, I didn’t even know the guy, but just being within two degrees of a death is always a very somber experience.

We moved to the living room and talked until about 3:15am. There was lots of talking of death, reminiscing, sharing of mine and Anthony’s best man stories with the new person (James’ girlfriend), some very heartfelt thoughts, some very lighthearted thoughts, and was overall very enjoyable, all things considered.

As mentioned, I cleaned up, and I wanted to get this out here. As for the past week since my last post, it’s safe to say that not a ton has really happened. I joined a new guild in WoW, and have been playing a lot more endgame stuff, since they’re a casual mature guild that also raids, which is pretty awesome, but it’s not huge events, especially after tonight.

I’ve experienced a lot more death in my life than I’d have liked to. I can think of at least five or six funerals I’ve attended, and at least two more that I didn’t due to various reasons, so anytime I hear about someone’s loss, it alwas sits pretty heavy with me. Tonight’s probably the first time I’ve heard about a loss since losing John where I didn’t feel like sobbing hard at some point, which I think is a sign of some growth and healing, which is still kind of weird. Time heals all wounds and such, but sometimes it’s hard to believe that some of them can actually heal.

This post has gotten so much longer than I initially anticipated, so I’m going to wrap up. I think I’m starting to feel the sugar/exhaustion crash set in, so I just need to go get a quick shower and then I can pass out for awhile. I’m hoping to sleep until at least 10. Thanks for listening to me go on. Go out and remind people that you love them, and give them a hug. It’s important. G’night.
