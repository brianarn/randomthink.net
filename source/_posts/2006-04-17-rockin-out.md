I got home today and my living room was filled with hordes of children! Well, just three kids, but it was quite a few more than the normal count of zero. My sister-in-law and mother-in-law were here too. I probably didn’t get to properly greet my wife with a hug and kiss for at least a half hour. After dinner, there was a mass exodus, including my wife, leaving just me. I didn’t feel like staying at the house for now, so I went to Best Buy.

My intent was on purchasing the DVD remote for my PS2, which I did. I also bought Jampacks 12 and 13, because I really didn’t know what else to buy. Maybe these demos will help me out there.

Then, there it was.

The Guitar Hero store demo.

This is where I cultivated my love for the game. It wasn’t where I was first exposed, but it’s where I really got to play several of the songs for the first time. It was like a homecoming.

I waited for the guy who was playing to finish, and he then pushed the guitar towards me. He even said “Go on, man, rock out.” I chuckled, and put the guitar on. He and his friend were there, and I loaded up “Take It Off” by The Donnas, and I did it on expert. The guy saw me select expert and even said “No way!” It was very amusing.

And thus, I began to rock out. I rocked out like never before. It was awesome. This guy and his friend called together the rest of their group walking through the store. At least four Best Buy staffers gathered up behind me. For a brief few minutes, I was not just a Guitar Hero, but a Guitar Legend.

Then, the song finished and everyone walked on and went on with their lives, so I handed the guitar to some little kid standing there, and listened to him butcher “Iron Man” as I walked away.

It was glorious.
