Taking a complicated form and converting it into an HTML form while trying to preserve the visual appearance can get really messy. While very clean in some ways, the piece of HTML I just wrote for work has to be one of the most convoluted pieces of HTML I’ve ever written. I have tables nested three deep simply because I was required to use tables.

While I love my job, I wouldn’t mind being able to write things that were more standards-compliant. I basically learn what not to do on a daily basis as I work my way through it. My HTML would be about a third of its current size if I could have used CSS, but I had to stick with tables for now. Crazyness.
