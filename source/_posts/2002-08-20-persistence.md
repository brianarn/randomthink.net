Today’s Franklin Covey © quote of the day:

> We are made to persist. That’s how we find out who we are.  
> –Tobias Wolff

Thinking about this quote makes me think of my current education. I’m working on persisting through the drudgery that is higher education in order to get my degree. Then again, this semester looks to be fun, educational, and exciting all at once. I guess I had to get through the lower-level material to get into this exciting stuff.

This semester will cover:

*   Optics and Quantum Physics
*   Multivariable Calculus (Calc III)
*   Database Management
*   Assembly language (I think for SPARCs)

Some great stuff. =) I’m happy to be in school right now, and glad I persisted. Getting through this intense academic summer helped shape me more, and prepare me for the classes ahead.
