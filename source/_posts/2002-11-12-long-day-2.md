So, today was quite a long day in some respects.

I forgot that today is my wife’s goofy schedule day, so I didn’t get up till 8am, which is when I meant to be at work. Oops. I got ready and went down to [UNM][1]‘s hospital, as my stepdad was receiving a PET scan. Apparently that’s when they inject you with some radiation, then an hour later they scan you, and based on the scan, you can tell if any objects inside of you, like tumors, are cancerous. They also took a CT scan, and can do what they were calling a fusion, combining the two for a more detailed look.

The reason this is all so hard is that there’s fear of lung cancer having returned – he’s already had half of one lung removed, and so it’s hard to imagine it’s returning again, and not terribly long after last time. We won’t know anything for a week, and my mom’s birthday is Sunday, so that’s a helluva frustrating thing to have to endure during your birthday.

I was with them at the hospital from 10:00 to 1:30, then they went home and I had my Physics lab (which was the highlight of the day, that’s kinda sad, hehe) and now I’m waiting for my wife to get home. That’ll be the real highlight of the day, I can’t wait to see her.

Listening to some random 80′s samplings, makes me feel better. Puts the world in a different perspective, reminds me of a simpler time.
