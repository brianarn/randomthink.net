I’ve really been trying to get some rest, but it’s just not been effective. I’ve been striving to catch up on homework, since I fell a bit behind due to recent events, but it’s not been terribly effective. I feel like this weekend, I’ll get some closure at the funeral. I mean, I watched him pass away basically, and I was there for the service last Saturday, but being there at the grave site will provide something beneficial, I hope.

If you’re the praying sort, would you keep the following in your mind?

*   My mom, for comfort and strength for her at this time
*   My wife, for comfort and strength as well – it’s going to be hard to be apart even for such a short time, since it’s such an infrequent thing. We haven’t been apart in almost two years.
*   Me, for the strength to be there to support my mom, and peace in knowing that my dad is in a better place now

Thanks. The therapy inherent in this blog is amazing to me right now.
