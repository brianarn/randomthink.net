This weekend was definitely one filled with some great joys and great sorrows all in one. My step-father is really sick and in the hospital, and to be honest, this subject is one of the rare few that I prefer not to discuss online, so I’ll talk about the joys.

I finally got all of the parts and have my new computer built! It’s wonderful. It’s like living the dream. It’s got an Athlon 1800+ XP (rated at 1.53GHz, but I could easily crank it), 512MB of PC2700 DDR RAM, an 80GB HDD, and a Radeon 9000 Pro that a good friend just gave to me. Talk about generous! We also put in an special heatsink and fan that are incredibly quiet. I can barely hear that the computer is on. Our old computer across the room is notably noisier.

My friend came over on Saturday morning and helped build it, then we did this homework for a class that was relatively worthless. Once that was done, we decided to try and hammer the processor and see how hot it would get. At one point, we were doing a huge compile (binutils in cygwin, for those interested), a Perl script that we simply left incrementing and sleeping for 0.01 seconds every million increments, so that the compile wasn’t totally shut out, and then started up SimCity 4. With very minor changes in SimCity’s operation, we played for about twenty minutes, then quit to check the hardware history. That’s something I didn’t mention: I have a utility to monitor my CPU and motherboard temperatures, as well as the speeds of the different fans. After doing all of the described above, my processor had gone from 36 degrees Celsius up to about 39-40 degrees. The fan went from around 2800 RPMs to 3300, and it can crank up to 4800, so I’m sure I’m not going to have any heat problems. Even now, the processor is only at 37 degrees, and the fan around 3000 RPMs.

So, needless to say, I’m quite happy. This is an excellent step in the right direction.

Oh, we also finally did our taxes. We don’t have to pay, so that’s good. We’re not getting a ton back, but it’ll certainly be welcome income. I’ll try to post more soon.
