The service today was beautiful. It was very sweet, very hard. Lots of closure. [Carlos][1] said being a pallbearer would bring me lots of closure, and in some ways it did. It was also very hard, because I was shaking a little bit and I thought I was going to drop the corner, but I didn’t, so that’s good.

I’m feeling really sad and missing my grandma, so I’m not going to say much more at this point. Maybe more tomorrow.
