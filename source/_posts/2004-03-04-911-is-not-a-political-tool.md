or at least it shouldn’t be.

I’m doing homework right now, but I just saw another Bush ad, and it bothered me so I wanted to take a short break to write this post out.

When Bush was initially elected, I wasn’t too happy. When the attacks on September 11th occurred, I was freaked out really bad – living near Washington, DC only amplified that. I actually became quite happy with Bush for awhile. It felt like things were on the right track. Now, I’m not so sure. It seems more and more like we went to war against Saddam Hussein with bad information. Do I think that, overall, the people of Iraq will be better off? Possibly, but there’s also been so much turmoil and whatnot that it’s been almost a year now, a soldier dies almost every day, and things are still fairly unstable (at least it seems), so I’m not so sure that I’m happy about the actions Bush has taken. To be fair and honest, before these ads, I felt like I’d probably vote for Kerry but I could see myself going either way. My faith in Bush had declined.

Now, if you haven’t seen one of these ads, there are a couple of them, and they seem to focus on the fact that Bush was the leader during the attacks and that we’re safer now. To be honest, I feel much less safe now. I’ll be the first to admit that I was quite oblivious to the dangers we faced, and it’s possible that I’m still very oblivious, but I would definitely say that I don’t feel safer. Also, seeing these images invokes feelings that I had basically shut down for awhile, and it feels like Bush is using it more for personal gain, so the compound effect is that I find myself disliking Bush more and more.

Normally I try to avoid politics, as I generally dislike the flaming that may follow, but I felt an urge to say that I’m very displeased with the new Bush ads. They feel way too focused on 9/11, and it feels like he’s abusing the events simply for personal gain. I heard some pundit saying that Bush has to use the events of 9/11, as that really was the largest thing to happen in his term, but at the same time, his approach leaves a really sour taste in my mouth.
