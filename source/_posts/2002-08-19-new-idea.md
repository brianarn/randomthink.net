On the main [Randomthink][1] page, I just posted about how school is starting, and how I’ll have more to say. I’m going to try and distribute my thoughts between the two sites, as well as work on my personal site.

My new idea is to take the quote of the day from my Franklin planner and expound a bit – seems like it would be a good mental exercise. So, without further ado, here’s today’s quote.

> Holding on to anger only gives you tense muscles.  
> –Joan Lunden

Sometimes the quotes come from unlikely sources. There was a great quote from Will Smith one day.

I can’t agree with this quote more. I am not one who is quick to anger, and I rarely hang onto it. There is really only one person ever at which I’ve held anger. She claimed to be my uncle’s daughter, and he’s tried to treat her as such at times (ten years ago or so) but he openly admitted once that it wasn’t true. She said some really nasty things to me, as well as insulting comments about my mom, and she even managed to get me kicked off of the bus (we were in the same middle school) on my birthday. What a present that was.

I remember that anger, and it hurt inside. Anger is one of the most destructive things I’ve ever encountered, and so I do my best to not get angry. Sometimes I get frustrated, but I really do my best not to let it boil over.
