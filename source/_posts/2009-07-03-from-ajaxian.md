Hello!

If you’re finding this blog for the first time from my [HTML5 Drum Kit][1] from [this post on Ajaxian.com][2], welcome to my meager site!

I feel like a cobbler who has no shoes of his own – or perhaps, one that is wearing a brand name instead of his own. I haven’t invested proper time on my personal site. For that I apologize. I’m working on a better version (possibly either a custom CMS or moved into ExpressionEngine). Hopefully I’ll get to do that over the fourth.

I’ve done a few other things, namely some stuff with <canvas> a year ago or so. It’s all in the [RandomThink Labs][3], which are all pretty ugly right now visually, but hey, that’s part of the cleanup/rework I want to undertake. All the code in the labs is under an MIT license and also available at [this GitHub repo][4] if you want to just grab it all.

Thanks for stopping by!
