Well, today is the big day! Although she’s technically not done with classes until mid-September or so, my wife Lisa is getting to go through the once-a-year graduation ceremonies at the University of Phoenix. She attends courses at UoP online, and really enjoys how easy it is, but if her employer didn’t pay for it, we couldn’t afford it. The online courses are great, but it’s just a bit costly.

Anyways, she’s going to be walking the line today. She’s getting ready now, and I just finished getting ready. It’s very exciting! One of the neat things about the ceremonies is that, while we attend courses from our home state, we actually had to come to Phoenix for the ceremonies, so I’m posting this from our lovely Doubletree Guest Suite. This hotel provides a 10Mbit connection, and it seems to be up there in terms of speed, so that’s pretty good. The Internet connection for the high-speed is ony $9.95 a day, which isn’t too bad.

We’re so very excited about all of this – Lisa’s almost done, and we get to celebrate it today. I’m going to finish my bachelor’s degree (hers is in IT, I’m going to be in Computer Science) in December, so we’re hopefully going to hold one heck of a party before Christmas.
