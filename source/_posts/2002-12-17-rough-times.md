Well, I’ve really been slacking at the blogging lately, so this entry might be kind of long.

On the 6th of December (not last Friday, but the one before) my wife’s great grandmother passed away. It was rather quick, and seemed pretty painless, so that part is good. A lot of people don’t quite understand the relationship involved with their family though. She was more like a grandmother than a great grandmother. Their entire family is really close, and so it was really hard to see her pass away. It was a little easier than last year, when her husband passed away, and much quicker, so there was a little comfort in that. There was a rosary held that Sunday, and the funeral was on Monday morning. There was a mass held for her, as she was Catholic, and it was a really beautiful service. The spirit of God truly was there, and gave me great comfort in knowing she is in Heaven with her husband now, enjoying the eternal life that is simply unimaginably full of happiness and joy.

I also found out that my dad (well, stepdad, but more of a father than my natural father) was officially diagnosed with lung cancer for the second time, and has been given a 40-60% chance of survival for one year. Make it five years and the percentage drops to 5%. That was really hard to hear, and is still slowly sinking in, even though I heard about it around a week ago.

I’ve been somewhat down, which is rare for me during this time of year. Of course, considering the circumstances in life lately, it’s quite understandable. My mom and dad are coming over to dinner tonight, which is wonderful to me. Even though we’ve been living in our current apartment for just over a year, my dad has never been up to see it. He has other issues aside from the cancer that make it hard for him to go places much, combined with a bit of depression, and as such has not ever made it over. Having him come over makes not just me happy, but my mom too. She’s been over a few times, and has tried to get him over to our place before, but it’s never happened. Something tends to change at the last moment, and I guess that’s a possibility tonight too, but I have good feelings about it.

I think my gout has spread to other places aside from my foot. My left knee hurts like crazy, especially when I bend it. I stayed home from work yesterday to work on my home PC, because I have a way to put my leg up and keep the knee from bending. I don’t have that same luxury at work, and as such my knee is hurting like crazy now. My right second toe (not the big toe, it’s neighbor) has started hurting today, so walking sucks. However, I have much walking to do today, so that’s going to be a real joy.

I have to go turn in my application to be a tutor today, since I’m losing my job at the end of the week. Being laid off is no fun. The tutor thing looks to be a sure thing, and it’ll basically be sitting in the library waiting for people to show up for help, getting paid $8/hour, so that’s not bad at all, plus I get some sort of official National Tutor certification, which will look good on my résumé.

I used to play this game called [Legends of Terris][1], and even host a [website][2] for a friend related to the game. The group I used to be listed under, the Druids, is now having elections for a new GuildMaster, and of the two people up for election, both have been in the spot. One is a great candidate, and the other is arguably the worst person to have ever held the spot in the past, so that got me a bit riled up and I posted a very strong thought over on the message boards, which has stirred up some people. I am mentioning it here simply because it is a frustrating thing to me, and since this blog entry has turned into somewhat of a rant, I may as well add to it.

This is a very uncommon style of entry for me, and if it seems like I’m just venting, I don’t really mean to. In Rebecca Blood’s book, she says not to post in anger, and I feel like I’m posting more in depression and/or frustration than anger, so I don’t feel too bad about it. I’m just feeling somewhat down, and writing out this rather large blog entry is a helpful means of releasing some of that frustration in a more creative format.

To my friends who are reading this, I appreciate that you take the time to see what I have to say. Without my friends, both offline and online, my life would be much sadder. Thanks for being there to talk to me and to listen to me go on and on about life’s frustrations.
