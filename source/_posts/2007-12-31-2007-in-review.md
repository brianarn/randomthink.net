I have to say, 2007 has been quite an interesting year for me. Lots and lots of changes, some big, some small. I figured it’d be worth recapping the months. I should warn you, this post is quite the wall of text, so, click on through for the details.

January: I tried to do a Project 365 thing with pictures and quickly burnt out after a week. So much for that. I never did spell out explicit resolutions, which is probably good.

February: I turned 28. I think this year was the first year that I wasn’t stupidly excited about my birthday. I don’t know why, but I just didn’t feel it as much this time around. That being said, I held a gaming birthday party, and it was most wonderful — it had record attendance as my gaming events go.

March: I got my big makeover from Albuquerque: The Magazine. I find it kind of sad that I did that ten months ago and **still** haven’t really written up a post about my experiences. Heck, I have an email that I sent to the editor of the magazine with details, which I could probably do some copy/paste magic with, but I just haven’t done it yet. Maybe soon. Maybe never.

April: What happened in April? Honestly, little comes to mind. It’s around now that I wish I’d been better about blogging through the year. I probably did a worse job of blogging in ’07 than I have in any year prior. I’ll have to add that to the note of things to do better in ’08.

May: The big European trip! I’ve still only posted one of my daily blogs from Europe to this blog here. Boy, I was a horrid blogger this year. Seriously though, it was an absolutely wonderful trip.

June: Lisa and I celebrated seven years of marriage. Seriously, why she hasn’t tossed me out on my ear yet, I’ll never know, but I’m glad she hasn’t. We also added our awesome little dog Gryphon to our family, along with my MacBook Pro. No, Gryphon and the MBP aren’t on the same level — he’s higher priority, I swear — but they both came into my life on the same day. It’s not every day that you get both a new dog and a new computer.

July: The march of weddings started — five weddings in five months. Yeah, it’s just one per month, but it seemed a lot more hectic than it sounds. Life was ridiculously busy. We also got a new home theater system, which I don’t think I’ve ever really talked about on the blog here. It’s really great. 47″ LG HDTV combined with an Xbox HD DVD player make for a wonderful home theater experience. There’s also the great 5.1 surround sound system. Still haven’t really found a movie that seemed like a great all-around demo, though. Anyhow. I actually have a decent [July/August summary][1] already written as an older post, so, you can find more detail there.

August: Even though it’s in the July/August summary, I should mention it here — after all, this is the summary, the review, right? Huge life changing event: I shifted to my new job at [Bohannan Huston, Inc][2]. While work is work and there are always things that one would change, overall I have to say I’m incredibly happy with the job. I have a nice workspace (even if it’s not a full-on office, something I had at past jobs), great coworkers, and I generally enjoy the work I do. Heck, today I got to fix a fun JavaScript problem. Mmm, JavaScript.

September: Had my ten-year high school reunion. It was amusing in some ways, good in some, bad in others. I’ll probably go back to 20 and 30, but honestly, more to laugh than anything else. It was great to touch base with some people I hadn’t talked to in ten years, and it’ll probably be another ten years before some of us speak again, and that’s okay. Otherwise, the month was just work for me and school for Lisa — oh, and another wedding, probably the most fun one of the set.

October: The last wedding in the stretch, and we hosted a dinner in a Halloween theme. It was a lot of fun, and Gryphon was cute in his Halloween scarf. October felt busy, although I can’t pinpoint much else going on at the time. It was probably just Lisa’s school.

November: More work for me, more school for Lisa. Thanksgiving was nice. Life was generally quite busy. On November 20th, Rock Band was released and I found myself with a whole new addiction, although for once, this is a console game that Lisa can enjoy with me. I’ll have to write up a bigger post soon (yet another one I really should have already written), but as a quick summary point, I should say that Lisa and I rock out at least a few times a week.

December: Yet another crazy busy month, but Christmas tends to do that. Celebrations started as early as December 15th, wherein we went down to my mom’s house — my stepdad works on Christmas and so he and his kids get together early and do Christmas then. There was also the company party, and on Christmas day itself, we had around five stops to make, keeping us out for over twelve hours. Again, one more big post I should write up.

I keep telling myself that the things holding me back from blogging this year is that I’ve simply had a lot of big events to talk about, but haven’t sat down to put pen to paper (or fingers to keys, I guess, would be more accurate) and get it all out. I really need to not let these big things bog me down, and just write about what feels good, and I really should take the time to write the big stuff out.

Tonight we’re hosting a New Year’s party, and it should be most awesome.

Tomorrow, I expect I’ll put up a post talking about some goals for the new year. Good times ahead!
