Imagine that – two posts in one night. I thought about doing one huge, giant, million-thoughts-at-once sort of post, but instead I opted to split by topic.

On Sunday, my wife and I went to Wal-Mart and did a huge grocery run, and in the process I happened to see some [Morningstar Farms][1] products together. For the uninitiated, Morningstar produces many vegetarian products. I wouldn’t call them vegan, as I know some things contain egg and dairy elements, but for your average vegetarian, they’d suffice, I’m sure.

Now, you might ask yourself, “Is Brian a vegetarian?” I’m not, but you see, back when I lived in Virginia with my friend [Carlos][2], he bought these Morningstar hot dogs, and I fell in love with them. Since then, I’ve dabbled in the vegetarian foods, and find that I really enjoy them.

So, upon seeing the huge frozen section of Morningstar products, I wondered what else they offered when my eyes fell upon a unique product – [Morningstar buffalo wings][3]. In reality, they looked like little [Chicken McNuggets][4]. I don’t know why, but over the past few months, I’ve been utterly obsessed with buffalo wings, wanting to eat them everywhere I possibly can. I was never a big fan of them before, but there’s just something about the taste. I decided I needed to try some Morningstar Buffalo Wings.

We bought the wings, but I hadn’t had a chance to try any until this evening. If you look at the links above, both are links to the nutritional information regarding both the buffalo wings, as well as Chicken McNuggets. The serving size for the buffalo wings was five pieces, so I opted to look at the four-nugget serving.

In all aspects, Morningstar is healthier, but not by a large margin. Five pieces of Morningstar Buffalo Wings are worth 200 calories, whereas four Chicken McNuggets are worth 210 calories. The wings have 9 grams of fat, 1.5 of which are saturated, whereas the nuggets are 13 and 2.5 respectively. No cholesterol in the buffalo wings, 35 milligrams in the nuggets. Surprisingly, the buffalo wings have 630 milligrams of sodium, whereas the nuggets are only at 460 milligrams. The wings have 18 grams of carbohydrates, the nuggets have 12.

In some ways, people might consider it unfair to contrast the Morningstar Buffalo Wings with Chicken McNuggets, but to be honest, not only did they look like Chicken McNuggets, they tasted like them with some buffalo spicing.

Overall, I was really quite pleased with the product, and would buy them again. The only problem is that, I used to order the 9 or 20 McNugget (there were no 4 or 10 count orders when I used to eat at McDonald’s regularly, apparently there are now), and so when hungry, I’d want to eat the whole box of the Morningstar Buffalo Wings. I counted, and there were sixteen in the box. I ate eight of them, and they really were good. I almost want to go and eat the others, but I’ll save those for another long night of homework.
