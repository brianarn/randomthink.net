Via the [Merriam-Webster][1] Word of the Day program, today’s word is “crapulous”.

> **crapulous** KRAP-yuh-luss (adjective)
> 
> 1.  Marked by intemperance especially in eating or drinking
> 2.  Sick from excessive indulgence in liquor

So, keep in mind that saying that you are crapulous after a night of drinking is actually a valid word. It’s like the opposite of fabulous after a heavy night of drinking.
