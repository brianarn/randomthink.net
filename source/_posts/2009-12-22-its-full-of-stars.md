I’m hoping to make this more of a thing, where I make fun little toys in HTML5. I made my drum kit sometime back, and had played around with <canvas> some last year. Since I’m kind of signed up to talk at [Webuquerque][1] on the topic of <canvas> and similar such technology (at the time of my speech in April, Firefox 3.7 should be in some late beta, if not RC, hopefully, meaning WebGL will soon be upon us), well, I should probably actually learn what the heck I’m talking about.

So then, here’s a fun little toy I made. For lack of a better name, I just called it [Stars][2] and put it somewhere under my [RandomThink.net Labs][3] area (which may someday get its own content management setup, which I hoped to do in EE but it’s just easier to hack on plain files for that so who knows). It needs some better documentation, but I’m sorta-working on a better version with more controls. I’ll be sure to blather on about it at that point.

I’m more apt to quickly shout about these sorts of things on Twitter (and to a lesser extent, Facebook), so if you want to be in the know, you should maybe follow me on Twitter [here][4] or add me on Facebook [here][5]. Also worth noting, there’s an RSS feed of my tweets [here][6], if you want to listen without being a tweeter. However, that doesn’t filter out any replies I make to others, so, y’know, you’ll be getting one side of a conversation without seeing the rest. Anyhow. Maybe I’ll install Twitter Tools to incorporate my tweets more heavily into the blog or something.

But yeah. [Stars][2]. Go play. Start the animation, then move over and hold down the mouse button somewhere for a fast spray of stars, or use the click-hold to queue up a ton of stars while not animating. Dabble a bit. Trace out your name in stars before animating and then start it up. Eventually you can put enough stars to cause some lag, but it’s really not too terrible.
