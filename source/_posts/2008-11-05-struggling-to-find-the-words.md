I may come back and do a Working Wednesday post to try and keep the theme going (and I do have an idea for something to write on that theme), but I figure, for now, I should just put something out.

Last night, watching the returns, I got chills several times over. I’m sure I cried a little. I wish I could say that it was due to overwhelming emotion that for the first time in my life, I’ve been on the winning side of a vote, but that wasn’t all of it.

Barack has a long road ahead of him. To have lost his grandmother so close to the election had to have made giving last night’s speech so immensely difficult.

Another friend of mine lost his grandmother this week. I’ll be attending that rosary tonight. His whole family has always treated me like I were family, and even if I haven’t seen them recently, I know that while it’s not my family, I’ll feel very at home with them.

I lost my grandma back in 2003, some months after having lost my dad.

Last night was just a lot of emotion, from both recent events and triggered memories, and I really can’t find words to properly express the emotion.

Democrats: We’ve handed you the keys. Please do right by us. As a nation, we’ll be watching very closely.

Here’s looking forward and hoping to finding joy and peace in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
