I could (and probably should) write about my birthday and such (and will soon), but I got this from a friend, and figured it’d be worth sharing for those of you reading this who will now be affected by the cell phone ban. Birthday post will be up someday, I swear. I just need to get the images onto Flickr. Anyhow, here we go.

* * *A new law will be in effect in the City of Albuquerque on Friday, which states that you will no longer be able to use a cell phone while driving unless you have a “hands free” adapter. For the first 60 days they give a warning, but after that they will begin issuing citations. I went to Best Buy and they wanted $50 for a headset with a microphone for my cell phone. Having a friend in the cell phone business, I talked with him and was able to come up with an alternative, working through Office Depot.</p> 

These kits are compatible with any mobile phone and one size fits all. I paid him $0.08 each because he bought in quantity. Then we tried it with Motorola, Sprint, Verizon and Nokia units and they worked perfectly.Below is a sample photo. Let me know if you want one. Also, share this information with anyone you know, who has a cell phone, and who may want one!

It’s no small coincidence that the stupidity of this picture is directly proportional to the stupidity of the ban.
