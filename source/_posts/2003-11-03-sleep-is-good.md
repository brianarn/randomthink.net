I don’t know what it is, but for some reason, when I get stressed or overloaded, my body tries to shut down on me and go to sleep. It’s a bad response system in a way, since sleeping doesn’t really do anything but delay the inevitable. It’s better than going out and getting plastered, that’s for sure, but even so, it’s a frustrating thing.

Services are set for Wednesday at 2:00pm, so I’m taking off half of work.

Surprisingly, work is actually a bit of a relief, a release. Whenever I start doing development, especially web development, it kind of calms me down. It’s nice when I get things to work too. I’m struggling with something at this point. I’m basically trying to make a web service, and having little luck. Time to hit up the bossman to see what other options I have with this project.
