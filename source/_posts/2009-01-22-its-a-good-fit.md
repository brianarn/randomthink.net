I’ve been holding back on posting this one, because I wanted to wait until [Jason][1] had a chance to see it in person. Not sure why, just, felt like I wanted to share with him and a few others in person before I went and said it more loudly.

Nearly three years ago, I talked about our new Honda Accord. I was very excited about it at the time, and I made the comment that “it’s kind of like a big Civic”.

However, it turns out, I don’t really like bigger cars.

I really don’t like to complain too much. Frankly, I’m blessed to have been able to get the car at all, and am very thankful for the three years that it carried me from A to B. However, I never felt comfortable in it. I mean, perhaps I was physically comfortable, but it just felt way too big for me. I never developed a good sense of space with it. I was never comfortable parking it. It was much harder to drive comfortably than the Pilot ever has been.

For the past few months, we’ve been thinking about what to do with the Accord. We figured we wouldn’t be keeping it. We went to a number of dealerships and test drove a few cars, but nothing felt quite right. There was one car that we hadn’t test driven yet that I wanted to check out, but we just couldn’t find the time.

Well, the Pilot was nearing the end of its lease, and we were in talking to the financial people, and they noted that the Accord was coming up due, and if we were willing to wrap up both vehicles in one day, they could get us some breaks. Then they suggested that they had some cars we could try out, and a salesman brought around a Honda Fit.

The month after we got the Accord, Honda brought the Fit to the US. For years, I have been reading about this car, and really, it’s all I’ve wanted since. It doesn’t hurt that it’s gotten really good ratings for years now and is incredibly economic when it comes to fuel. We test drove it and both of us fell in love. It’s really a good fit for us.

I want to take some nice daylight pictures (like I did for the Accord), but for now, here’s a picture from the website (again, like the way I posted about the Accord).

On the whole, I’m immensely pleased. It’s way more fun to drive than the Accord ever was. It’s much more fitting to me. It’s smaller, more nimble, way more fuel efficient, and even safer than the Accord, and I fully look forward to driving it for [at least the next thirteen years][3].

I may even pick up an amp and some beefed-up speakers. For old time’s sake. (My cars in high school had ridiculously overpowered audio systems for such small cars.)
