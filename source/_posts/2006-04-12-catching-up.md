Been way too long, so, let’s do some catching up.

On the weekend of the 1st, if I remember right, Nasser had a birthday party of sorts for himself. A ton of us showed up, and wound up playing a 10-man session of Settlers of Catan.

“But Brian, can’t only up to six people play Settlers of Catan?” That’s true, but we had some teaming going on. Nasser, Lisa and I all played our own sets, while Anthony and Audra teamed up on one player, another couple of teamed up, and then one three-person team played as well, so six players, but ten people. Lisa was triumphant in the end. The game took ages, but that’s okay. It was still a blast.

On the 31st of March, I picked up a Playstation 2, after only about six+ years of their availability. I already owned a copy of Katamari Damacy which I’ve already effectively defeated, and also purchased Guitar Hero, which I’m spending way too much time with. I think it’s going to slow down quite a bit now, as I’ve hit a solid plateau, but hopefully I’ll get past it with frequent play.

Current Guitar Hero status:

*   Easy: 25/25 songs complete, 25/25 songs with 5 star rating
*   Medium: 30/30 songs complete, 24/30 songs with 5 star rating
*   Hard: 26/30 songs complete, 5ish/30 songs with 5 star rating
*   Expert: 24/30 songs complete, 1/30 songs with 5 star rating

Last night I played for like 2.5 hours, completing 21 of those expert songs. Insanity. My wrist got tired. I probably won’t play tonight.

The weekend of the 1st was really overloaded with gaming. Between the new PS2, the board game party night, more board games on Sunday, some archery even, and a ton of WoW (like five or six hours that Saturday morning, plus other stints here and there) I got really tired of recreation and was actually kind of looking forward to going back to work.

Lisa got really sick on the 5th. As best as we can tell, it was food poisoning. I stayed home to help take care of her — it was really bad. She stayed home for two days, which is insanely rare for her. She usually just powers through everything. It was scary at the time, but she’s recovering nicely.

Lisa worked Saturday, so I played a little WoW that morning, cleaned a little, and played yet more Guitar Hero. On Sunday, we slept in and didn’t do much, aside from purchase a couple of nice nightstand tables that we need to put into place.

Not a whole lot going on lately. I feel some guilt about all of the gaming when I sit and think about it, because I’ve been playing a lot more in the past couple of weeks than I have in a long time, and it makes me think that maybe I could be doing something a bit more productive. I have things I’d like to do with my website, for example, but I just haven’t gotten to them. I’m sure I could find things around the house to do, or maybe finally get into some workout routine.

I was talking with Lisa’s dad over the weekend, and he said that his real problem when it comes to his hobbies is discipline. I’d say I have similar issues that I need to work on. I’m out of thoughts now, so, more later.
