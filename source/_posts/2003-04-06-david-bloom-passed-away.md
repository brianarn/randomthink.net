[MSNBC.com – NBC’s David Bloom dies in Iraq][1]

I heard this on the news this morning, and was struck by an incredible sadness. I had watched David Bloom hosting Weekend Today many weekends over the past few years, and was impressed with his coverage of the war. In an odd way, it brings me some comfort that his passing wasn’t directly war-related, and the MSNBC article linked above does him justice. It makes me so very sad in part because he was my favorite personality of the embedded press. I enjoyed his reports more than any other, and had already read some of the things in the article above, like the descriptions of his "Bloommobile" that he rode around in, getting such amazing footage.

David Bloom’s family will be in my heart and prayers, for they’ve lost quite a guy. Even though I didn’t know him personally, I feel confident in saying that he was one of the few journalists out there with integrity to spare, and amazing charm, charisma, and potential to do great things. David, you will be missed.
