It’s hard to believe I’m writing a second entry like this in the same year. Back in April, my stepdad passed away. The realization is there, and yet it still doesn’t feel quite right. There’s a void there, but the pain has gotten a bit numb. It still hurts from time to time. I find myself breaking out into random spurts of crying once in awhile, it’s very odd.

Well, as I’ve mentioned a few times over the past couple of weeks, my grandma has been in the hospital, from things such as not expelling her carbon dioxide properly to trying to clear up pneumonia and getting a feeding tube into her stomach. I didn’t realize how bad things had been getting, but apparently they had been getting much worse than I realized. My grandmother, Ethel Seay, passed away on Saturday, November 1st, 2003 at around 3:15pm MST.

Once again, I’ve got those feelings of pain and grief in that I feel like my grandma may not have really known how much I cared for her, but not quite like I got with John. While it wasn’t perfect, I did get a chance to see my grandma one last time while she was in the hospital, and it was probably at the peak of her time there. She was looking really good, sounding good, and everything seemed fine. I really had no idea she was going to pass away so soon, and that makes it all that much harder. With John, we knew it was coming, at least for a few days. With my grandma, I knew it for maybe one day.

This time, I would ask my readers to pray for my grandmother, because even though she is gone, I feel like some prayer would be good, and also to pray for my grandfather and my mom. I’ll be okay, and while I could always use prayer (who couldn’t?), my mom and grandpa need it more. They were married something like 57 years, and so this is going to be very hard for him, and it’s going to be dredging up some really painful memories for my mom – actually, it already has. It’s a very painful thing, and they need all the support that they can get. Thank you.
