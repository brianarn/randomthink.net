So, as noted in a post yesterday, I’ve got a new cell phone. I haven’t gotten a new cell phone in a number of years, so it’s very nice to upgrade.

For any interested parties, the phone I now have is a [Samsung A620][1], which goes by a multitude of other technological monikers, including the Samsung VGA1000. It’s an A620 to most people though.

There are a number of nice features, including:

*   T9 text system for quick text entry
*   A bajillion types of ringers, including full audio (not just MIDI) ones
*   A built-in digital camera, featuring up to 640×480 resolution and a really tiny nearly worthless flash
*   SMS capability, although this feature was unknown to the salesperson at the time

I must say that, overall, I’m pretty pleased. The one thing I’m not a fan of so far is that when I take a picture, there’s no way to attach the JPG to an email and send it out. I have to use Sprint’s Picture Mail system to send it out, which means that I will have to either accept that [moblogging][2] is probably not going to happen, or I’m going to have to throw together some hack on my webserver. I wouldn’t mind doing that, so that I could possibly set up a moblog gallery rather easily. Worst case, if I really wanted to, I could take the time to move the pictures from Picture Mail over to my gallery, but I’m a lazy kind of guy. The more I can get the computer to work for me, the better.

Hope you’re having a great day!
