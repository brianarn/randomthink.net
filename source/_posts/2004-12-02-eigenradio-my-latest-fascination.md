Eigenradio – <http://eigenradio.media.mit.edu/>

I’m really fascinated by this concept. From their site:

> All those stations, playing all that music, all the time! There’s at least 40 different songs being played every week on most radio stations! Who has enough time in the day to listen to them all? That’s why we’ve set up banks of computers to do the listening for us. They know what you really want to hear . They’re trading variety for variance.
> 
> Eigenradio plays only the most important frequencies, only the beats with the highest entropy. If you took a bunch of music and asked it, “Music, what are you, really?” you’d hear Eigenradio singing back at you. When you’re tuned in to Eigenradio, you always know that you’re hearing the latest, rawest, most statistically separable thing you can possibly put in your ear.

It’s actually kind of interesting to listen to. They used the tech that runs Eigenradio and fed it tons of Christmas songs, and have now released the [ultimate Christmas album][1]. It’s interesting. Not necessarily good, but interesting.

The guy credited with creating Eigenradio, [Brian Whitman][2], also generated a list of [Ten Thousand Statistically Grammar-Average Fake Band Names][3]. I find that I’m particularly amused by some, such as “Cocky Magpie” and “Shocker Ferret”

Fun stuff with computers and music.
