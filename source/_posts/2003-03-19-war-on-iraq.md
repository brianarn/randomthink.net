So, it started tonight.

Even though there was tons of hype before it, and everyone knew it was going to eventually happen, it was still a bit of a shock. We had just gotten home from the church where my wife received a calling, turned on the TV and heard that there had been explosions in Baghdad, and then the President came on and said that the disarming had begun.

Even after all of the time I’ve had to think about it, I’m still not sure if I agree with the causes of the war or not. I can understand disarming Iraq, and Saddam Hussein certainly seems like a threat, but part of me wonders if any more time with diplomacy would have been good. Then, another part of me argues that any more time with diplomacy would have been fruitless, so I really don’t know. I guess it’s a moot point, as the war has started.

A couple of days ago, I was heavily driven to prayer, and it was a feeling that was both scary and good. I felt like I was being called to prayer, something I haven’t felt in years, and that was the good part. It was scary to think about all of the things about to happen, but also relieving to put it in His hands.

I think that’s my greatest comfort in all of this – knowing that, I don’t understand his plan, but that it’s all a part of it, and that good will eventually come of the events. That’s my hope and prayer at this point.
