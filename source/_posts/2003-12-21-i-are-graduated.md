Well, today (or yesterday at this point) was the big day – my graduation. I now have a Bachlor of Science in Computer Science. It was nice to walk the line, as it really help cap things off for me. It feels more, well, complete. The convocation today was roughly two hours or so, from 10:00AM to about noon. We still have [Adam][1]‘s digital camera, and so we set it into super-resolution mode and snapped off some pictures. My grandpa made it to the ceremony, and I’m very happy about that. I am the first grandchild to get a higher level of education than high school, so that’s very exciting as well.

After the ceremonies, we went to the little reception (which was fairly boring, unlike last semester), then we had a nice lunch at [Red Robin][2]. After lunch, we headed to my mother-in-law’s house and prepared for my graduation party.

Over the course of the evening, from around 5:30 to 10:00, we had a number of people show up, including all of the people who I consider to be my best friends, such as [Carlos][3], Anthony, and Nasser. Adam was there too, and that made me happy. I’m glad he got to make it. Adam, we need to hang out more often.

Janelle and her new beau were there, but they had to leave early to pick up Melanie at the airport, after which they headed down to [Graham Central Station][4]. Once pretty much everyone had cleared out from the party, we also headed down there. It was me and Lisa, Carlos, Anthony and his girlfriend Audra, who is a very nice person.

When we got there, there was a huge line, but it went really fast. We weren’t outside but maybe ten minutes. Inside there were basically four major areas – South Beach, which was the techno/rap place, Denim ‘n’ Diamonds which I shouldn’t have to describe, the retro area named Bellbottoms or something like that, and then a karaoke section called Alley Cats. Over the course of a few hours we spent time in every area, although the Bellbottoms got the least attention. Lisa and I, and Anthony and his girlfriend, were the last ones to leave of the people we knew. Janelle and Melanie and company left shortly after we got there, for a multitude of reasons, but they had already been there at least two hours so I could understand.

Now that I’m home, I was able to grab the pictures off of the digital camera and get instant feedback on the day, and while there are a number of good shots, it gave me a perspective on myself that I hadn’t really noticed before, or recently anyways. Looking at these pictures of myself made me feel really conscious of my weight, something that I haven’t been taking the best care of lately. It’s very motivating in a sense, as it helps me want to do more work on myself.

As the four of us guys were talking tonight (me, Carlos, Anthony, Nasser), Anthony made an interesting observation. A lot of the games that we play involve us taking some sort of virtual persona and investing time in that persona, developing various skill sets, as well as core characteristics such as strength and intelligence. He said he made the realization that the time spent on these characters is somewhat silly, as really we could invest that time in improving ourselves more. He made the point that games are a good form of entertainment and so that piont shouldn’t be devalued, but at the same time it was a very striking point.

The more I think about it, I’ve invested way too many hours of my life in working up these virtual characters. Does this mean I’m planning on not playing any more games? No, of course not. They’re still an excellent means of resting and relaxing for me, as well as a wonderful means of recreation with friends. What it does mean, however, is that I think I will be more interested in investing time in myself now. Seeing pictures of me made me feel both frustrated and motivated at the same time.

I’m already working up a list of new years resolutions now. I should consult with [my list from last year][5] to see how I did this year, and use that as a building point. I definitely need to develop a regular workout regiment and stick to it as best as I can, as well as work on relationships with friends and family, involving possibly small dinner parties and whatnot.

I’m feeling incredibly beat about now, something about sitting down and dumping these thoughts was very draining, but in a good way. I’m about to fall asleep, so I’m going to go to sleep now. I hope you’re having a good day.
