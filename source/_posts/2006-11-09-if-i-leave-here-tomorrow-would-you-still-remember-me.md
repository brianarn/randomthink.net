I know I should do a real post, but… Guitar Hero 2 is out now. That’s pretty much going to eat any/all free time for the next while.

Current progress:  
Easy: 28/28 — all 5-star, most 100%s  
Medium: 40/40 — all 5-star, some 100%s  
Hard: 40/40 — a couple of 3s, several 4s, several 5s  
Expert: 5/40 — all 3s and 4s, I think

This is all first pass. To the best of my memory, I haven’t repeated a song yet (at least, within a specific difficulty). Also, Trogdor and Thunderhorse are absolutely awesome bonus songs, and those are the only bonus songs I’ve hit yet.

I’ve also unlocked all songs, all characters, all outfits, all videos, all core guitars, and the fish and snaketapus guitars.

I am an ADDICT. It’s awful and I love it.

*Lord help me, I can’t change…*
