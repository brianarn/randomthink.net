Yesterday was a busy day. I went to a LAN party, and it was a blast. We played Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and C&C: Renegade. I had never played either. Both were a lot of fun. MOHAA seems to be mainly about killcount, whereas Renegade actually had a clear objective. I liked the concept behind Renegade a lot more, too. It was a good time. My friend Anthony (see my gallery if you want to put a face to the name, his 25th birthday party is shown in there) went as well, and so that was really neat. It was nice to meet a lot of these people I’d known online and had just never met. I’ll definitely be going to more of these if they have them.

Today is a sad day for Weird Al – his parents died of Carbon Monoxide poisoning. There is a thorough [article about the death of “Weird Al” Yankovic’s parents][1] over at nctimes.com. Very sad.

One time, [Carlos][2] and I were at his and Anthony’s place (Anthony was out at the time), and we tried using the oven to heat the place (for reasons I still don’t recall) and the next thing we knew, Anthony was in there opening windows and trying to get us up and moving. Carlos and I had both passed out, and as best as we can determine, the oven was letting out serious amounts of Carbon Monoxide. It’s a very scary thing. It’s awful to hear of Weird Al’s parents passing away from it. As my friend [Mark][3] (whom I got the link from) said about it, it happens all the time, but it’s really odd when it’s connected to a celebrity. I really enjoy Weird Al’s stuff, so I feel sad for him.

On a happier note, today is Easter. I hope that you and yours are having a good day today. Lisa and I will be going to my grandpa’s house for a lunch around noon, and then we’ll be heading down to her family’s place for dinner. It should all be really nice. I’ll be sure to take the camera with me. I took it to the LAN party yesterday, but because we’re all geeks playing games, nobody actually took any pictures. It’s okay, because it’s not like there was much to take pictures of – a bunch of guys, a girl or two, and a ton of computers.

I hope you’re having a good day. Enjoy the day. More missives as I come up with them.
