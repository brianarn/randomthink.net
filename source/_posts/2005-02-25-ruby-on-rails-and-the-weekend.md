I don’t understand why I go back and forth with blog postings. Some weeks, I’m just full of ideas. Others, I don’t have anything.

This week at work has been busy but also uneventful. I don’t feel like I’ve gotten as much done as I’d have liked. That bothers me.

For the coders out there, I started dabbling with [Ruby on Rails][1]. I have to say, after overcoming some initial difficulties, I am quite enamored of it. I don’t think I’m going to go all hardcore and say that Ruby is the best language ever and it’s all I’ll ever use again, but I will say that it’s pretty slick. It’s interesting to be able to apply the whole Model-View-Controller paradigm to web-based database driven applications. I’ve actually got a blog meme I’d like to create at some point, and so I’m thinking that I’ll use Ruby on Rails to be the engine behind it.

At some point this weekend, anywhere from within the hour to Sunday, Lisa and I will be hanging out with my good friend Anthony and his girlfriend Audra. I suspect good times will be had. Other than that, I don’t rightly know what the weekend holds. I think Lisa is going to be doing something with a friend of hers, which means I will probably have a couple of hours to play with Ruby on Rails, and that will be fun.

I’m so glad that there are so many programming languages out there. It’s fun. It keeps things interesting. There’s always something new to learn. It’s a blast to dabble with Ruby. Perl is still my first love, but Ruby is enjoyable nonetheless. Besides, once I’ve done something with it, I can always add it to my résumé, right?

I guess that’s it for now. More later!
