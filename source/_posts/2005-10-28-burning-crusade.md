I totally don’t know how I managed to miss this until just now. The World of Warcraft expansion has been officially announced!

[World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade][1]

After that video, and reading some of the content, I’m feeling incredibly giddy. Rumor was that it’d be out for the holidays, but now it looks like it’ll be more sometime next year. That’s incredibly frustrating in a way, but that just means we’ve got more time to get Lisa up to level 60 so that the two of us can venture in together. Aside: The level cap is going to be 70 now.

The first new race announced is the Blood Elves, which I’ve heard bugs some people, but at least now the Horde has a pretty race. Rumor is that the Pandaren (giant pandas) will be the new Alliance race. That sounds incredibly fun. It’ll be a blast to beat down some undead as a giant panda.

I’m incredibly excited about this expansion. While I hate to wait for such awesome content, I trust Blizzard at this point, and so I’m sure that the product will be pretty damn awesome.
