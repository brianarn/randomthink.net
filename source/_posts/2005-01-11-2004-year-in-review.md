I liked this concept, and I’ve seen a few people do it, so I’m going to go back through my blog, looking at each month, and write up a small quip describing that month last year.

January: I set a number of goals for myself that I didn’t really meet, so most of them still hold. I have a really bad experience with UPS that makes me want to choke someone. I get a bad cold, which seems to happen at least once per winter. We get a nice digital camera and I go nuts. I’m already sick of political ads.

February: I shatter my lovely platinum GBA and replace it. I’m fairly busy with school and way stressed, so I generally don’t post a lot, and what posts I do post are generally just links.

March: I’m exhausted overall. I got my PDA which I don’t use as much as I should. Lots more link posts, as I’m too exhausted to post much else.

April: I try to convince people that I pierced my tongue, but fail. Still busy and tired. I got my Xbox.

May: Lisa’s first business trip out of town is for just a week, and is very weird at first. I got my new cell phone and established my moblog. As of now, I’ve uploaded 469 photos with it, 207 of which are on the moblog, which is just mind-boggling. I moved over from Movable Type to WordPress for my blog software. I travel to Iowa for Memorial Day and visit my stepdad’s grave.

June: I swap my black GBA for a NES-themed one, as the black one had some pixel issues on the screen. My load at work starts to increase a bit. Lisa and I celebrate four years of marriage. Our house purchase becomes official.

July: Lisa is gone on another trip, and I take a moment to reflect on things. It’s weird to be an adult. Martha Stewart gets sentenced. I post some pictures of our house’s exterior, and we close on our home.

August: We move in to our new home rather quickly, and in all of the hustle and bustle I screw up my back. Work is getting more stressful and causing me to feel apathetic about a lot of things. I find a new diet/fitness tool online that I use for a few days. I start doing game review for Digital Entertainment News. Lisa gets sick. She then starts her super-long venture into Oklahoma.

September: Lisa is out of town, in Oklahoma, and I go visit, posting many pictures along the way. We have a lot of fun out there. She gets a weekend to come home. I’m generally sad while she’s gone, and wind up listening to “Dance with my Father” by Luther Vandross, which causes me to just totally break down and start crying about the loss of my stepdad. My mom remarries, and while I really do like the guy, it’s just kind of weird.

October: Lisa is still out of town, and I take another trip to Oklahoma. It’s very fun. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta hits town, and I take over 100 pictures that I still have yet to sort and post like I said I would. I get my first taste of riding in a hovercraft and am hooked. I went to a band competition and got one of the worst sunburns ever. My nephew has his first birthday. As a spur-of-the-moment thing, Lisa and I drive and meet in the middle in Amarillo for a quick overnight visit. Being apart this long has been really hard. Lisa finally gets home from her forever trip, and we have a nice Halloween where I carve some sweet Homestar Runner pumpkins.

November: The streak of the Redskins predicting the presidential winner is broken when Bush is re-elected. The [eagle][1] still can’t believe it. Work is getting super busy. I fall to the allure of iTunes and Halo 2. I pick up a Nintendo DS, and get a new server as well. The new server is great.

December: I am sucked into doing a bunch of clone pictures. I share my love of board games. Lisa and I go to California for my company’s Christmas party. I don’t post a lot because I’m just that busy lately, or so it seems.

So, that’s 2004 in review. It’s interesting to go back and look, and see how things have changed. 2005 will see more change, I am sure. I’m looking forward to the new year and what all it brings.
