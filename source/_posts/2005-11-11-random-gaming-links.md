Today is a good day for random gaming-related links.

*   [Meet the NES Micro][1] – This guy built a portable NES gaming system. Man, that would be so awesome. I still have my original NES (still works, too, last time I checked a couple of years ago), and easily 20 games. It would be great to be able to play them again in a portable form, even if the games are notably larger than the device itself.
*   [Mario meets Che][2] – Amusing. I don’t think I’d buy it, but, it’s still entertaining.
*   [Video Game Maps][3] – There are some amazing maps here. Talk about painstaking work. His work on Doom, Doom 2, and GTA: San Andreas are particularly amusing, and his work in Final Fantasy 2 (US) is so detailed and wonderful that it makes me want to go play through FF2 again. I absolutely loved that game. If there’s one FF they need to port to my Game Boy, it’s that one.
*   [Risk via Google Maps][4] – Interesting. Maybe I’ll find time to play Risk via this system, at some point in my life, maybe.
*   [Ninja Burger][5] – I got to play this card game recently at my friend Mark’s house. It was an absolute blast. It’s got a similar mechanic to Munchkin, and as such it has a similar feel, but I quite enjoyed it.
*   [Illuminati][6] – When I made the trek out to California for the Real Life Forums meet in June (previously [mentioned briefly][7]), I got to play this game with a few people. It had a very different feel from either Munchkin or Ninja Burger, and was really quite fun. I was doing pretty well too, until one particular card was played, which totally wiped me out. Good times.
*   [Puerto Rico][8] – I’ve yet to play this game, but I’ve heard nothing about good things about it. It’s got the highest ranking of any game on [BoardGameGeek.com][9], and that says something.
*   [Zombies!!!][10] – I would buy this game in a heartbeat, if I thought that Lisa might possibly play it once. However, recently we were at [Active Imagination][11], and I showed her the box, saying that I doubt she’d ever play it with me. After looking at the box for about, oh, three seconds or so, she said I was right, and so I put it back down. Maybe I should buy it for the sake of having a complete gaming collection.

I initially started this post off with video games in mind, but wound up rambling off into board games. Maybe that means I need to be playing some more board games soon. Maybe sometime in early December, I can organize another board gaming night. My last one was actually a solid success, with plenty of people showing up to play.
