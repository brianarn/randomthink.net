I need to pick up and move on. The Iowa trip, while difficult, also had some great points. It was good to meet all of the family that I’ve got but had never met.

I have a lot of catching up to do for school, but I should still easily make it through all of my classes. I have a large paper to write and a good deal of other homework to do, but I’ll be alright.

While painful, I’m thankful for my Iowa experience. I got to see another part of our beautiful country, and I met some great family.
