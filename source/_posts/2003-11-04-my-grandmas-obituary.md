Reading this obituary was very hard. I wanted to make a permanent copy on my site in case the ABQ Journal loses their archive at some point or makes it unavailable for some reason or another. I wish I had a copy of John’s (my stepdad), but I have a hardcopy around, as well as some other papers relating to his passing.

Tomorrow is going to be a very hard day. If I miss a posting tomorrow, I’m not going to be crushed, simply because it’s with understandable reason. Even so, I’ll probably post in the morning from work.
