So, yeah, I’ve moved from [Movable Type][1] to [WordPress][2]. I’m using a generic-ish CSS that I’ve snagged from [Alex][3]. I like the look of it. I still need to go back and edit these entries that contain images, since things have moved a bit. I know I’ve just caused a TON of linkrot, but at this point I’m not caring about that so much. Google will eventually catch up. For now, this is how it’s going to be. I need to clean up my pictures directory too, and I am probably going to be causing serious linkrot in doing that, but I suspect only a forum or two, and my blog, will really feel it. It’s alright, because it’s all a cleaning effort. I now have some great open source blog software, as well as some great open source gallery software, so I want to put both to good use. I might implement a wiki of my own for some interesting concepts like “life definition” – we’ll see. For now, I’m just enjoying the ride.

On an aside, I’m really glad that WordPress supports [Markdown][4] straight out of the box.
