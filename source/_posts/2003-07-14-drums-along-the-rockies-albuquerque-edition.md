My wife and I just got home from the Drums Along The Rockies, Albuquerque competition. The Phantom Regiment cleaned house amongst Division I, and the difference between second, third, and fourth was only about 0.35 of a point. Simply incredible. Revolution was also there, as the only Division II group. I’ve been talking to a mellophone player from Revolution via e-mail recently, and so it was awesome to see her playing. Admittedly, I wasn’t sure which one she was, but it’s still cool all the same. [Click here][1] to see the scores for tonight’s competition. They’re already posted – I’m quite amazed at that.

It’s funny – I’m sitting here typing up this entry, and the sound of the keystrokes almost sounds like a snare drum to me right now, simply because I’m so hyped up about that style of music right now. I really need to go out and pick up a few DCI CDs, as the music is just awesome. For those who don’t know, you really need to check out [the DCI website][2] for more information – see if an event is coming to your town!

Also, we’ve been informed that, while this year’s finals are being performed in Orlando, next year’s are being performed in Denver, Colorado! With any luck, my wife and I will be living in south Denver at that time, so we’re going to see about picking up some advance tickets now. I can’t tell you how exciting that is going to be. Tonight may have been the first time I was at a DCI event live, but I can promise you it won’t be the last time.
