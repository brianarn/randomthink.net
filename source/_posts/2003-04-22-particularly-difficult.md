For some reason, today is harder than yesterday was. I keep thinking about my dad, so many different thoughts and feelings.

I found out that I am to inherit his computer and all of the stuff he had for that. He was an avid gamer too, but in a different vein than I tended to play. He has some things that I have, like the Sims. Actually, I think Carlos still has my copy of that, so if for some reason I have an urge to play now, I’ll be able to. There’s a few flight sims, like MS Flight Sim 2002 and their combat sim, and the Black and White game with it’s expansion. He also had this beast of a joystick that works incredibly well, from what I understand.

It amazes me, the therapeutic value in writing this out here. I tell my wife and friends about this stuff, but sometimes just sitting down and tapping out my thoughts makes life easier. I miss my dad more than I would have imagined. Even if only one person reads this post, or even if nobody ever reads this post, it’s worth the effort because I feel better for having written it.

In her [book][1], [Rebecca Blood][2], one of the more well-known bloggers, talks about reasons for writing and maintaining a blog. If you’re writing your blog for your audience, and not yourself, then you need to re-evaluate your reasoning for blogging. If it turns into a chore, there’s a problem. My blog definitely falls more into the journal categories, as what few links I provide are simply for the edification of either readers who may not be familiar with what I’m discussing, or for myself at a later date to remind myself of what I was discussing at the time.

Take some time today, and remind someone that is special to you just how special they really are. I always strive to do something like this, to share with someone each and every day what they truly mean to me. I know that they know it, but it’s important to share it. After this loss, I realize it all the more.
