Before I get to the exciting news, I want to do a quick catchup of sorts. Also, technically it’s not *my* exciting news, but that’s okay.

*   Friday: We had dinner with our friends Janelle and Justin, who then came back to our house. We played some Guitar Hero and Wii Sports. It was most incredibly fun. I have some pictures and video of the playing, which I may post to be amusing, although I would feel bad doing so without their permission. At least, for the video part, I want permission.
*   Saturday: We spent most of the day with my sister-in-law Nicole and my nephews Isaac and Eric, 3 years and 6 months respectively. We also went to a party at my friend Hunter’s home and had fun there, playing Guitar Hero and having a post-Christmas white elephant gathering.
*   Sunday: Lisa went with Janelle to something for most of the day, and I completely forgot to take a picture so I’ve already broken the Project 365 thing, but I won’t dwell on that negatively, and will still work on frequent photography.

Anyhow, on Sunday I was playing a game or something when Nicole calls. She sounds excited and screams into the phone “We have exciting news!” I’m thinking that they’re pregnant again or something, so I ask “What?” in a very excited tone. She then screams into the phone “ISAAC POOPED IN THE POTTY!” I then get to talk to Isaac, and I naturally pour on the congratulations for having taken such an amazing step on his way to being a big boy.

In case you’re just skimming for the important news, let me say it again.

***MY NEPHEW ISAAC POOPED IN THE POTTY!***

Isaac, when you find this post in ten to fifteen years, you’d better thank me for being so excited over your poop.
