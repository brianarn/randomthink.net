Since my blog is fairly low-traffic and low-comment, I have it configured to send me an e-mail whenever someone posts a comment. I get sporadic comments on really old posts that people happen to find because of [Google][1] or [Yahoo!][2] or whatever search engine might index my site, and usually these comments are interesting. I had one person who commented on my [post on vegetarian buffalo wings][3] a few months after I wrote it. If it weren’t for the comment notification, I’d have never found it.

However, I received a new type of comment today. I think some months ago, someone posted a comment that was just basically an ad trying to drive traffic to their site. I’m sure he got all of zero hits from it. This new comment today though, was a link to questionable content. If I describe it at all, it’ll drive more of that traffic my way (something that’s happened before – [see reference][4]), so I think I’ll avoid mentioning it, and I’ll just say that I’ve already deleted the comment.

It’s not like my site is high traffic – do they really think they’ll get visitors by posting on my site?
