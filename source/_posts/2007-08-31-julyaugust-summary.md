Thanks to the magic of [Twitter][1], I have a nice [record of events][2], which I can then mine to summarize recent events. While I may not post as much as I should, I do try to at least send random bits to Twitter. There’s admittedly a lot more noise in the stream, but, it’s something, at least. So, here’s a quick summarized version of events along the way.

*   Lisa participated in a really interesting program with UNM, working with high school kids on spatial literacy. She did basically have to spend one full week in the dorms, but it wasn’t too bad, and the experience was great.
*   Gryphon likes to chew on things. That includes multiple hats and a really nice DS Lite case. It’s frustrating, and we’re doing what we can. He’ll be doing good for a week, and then suddenly chow down on some shoes or something. He’ll outgrow it, we hope.
*   We invested in a huge entertainment system. 47″ 1080p LCD television, Dolby 5.1 surround system, a nice entertainment center, and the Xbox 360 HD-DVD add-on as well. It’s most wonderful, and it’s hard to believe it’s been nearly two months already.
*   The final Harry Potter book came out. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ve started re-reading the series, and am now about halfway through the last book again. It’s really neat to see how much content J.K. Rowling threaded through the series.
*   Had another gaming night, which is always fun. Notably smaller than the one in February, but quite nice nonetheless.
*   Went to Drums Along the Rockies, which was a nice [DCI][3] event.
*   Guitar Hero 80′s edition came out. It’s fun, but it really feels like a money grab. I played it thoroughly for a week or two, and haven’t touched it since.
*   We’ve attended so many weddings, including being in one of them. It’s been great, and I have to say that the last one we were in was quite possibly the most fun I’ve had at a wedding in a long time. We still have one more to go to next month, and then the string of monthly weddings (one a month 
*   Picked up BioShock. I’m sure I’ll dedicate a post to discussing it once I’ve beaten it. I haven’t played a game this much (excluding WoW and Guitar Hero) since the late nineties with GoldenEye.
*   Lisa and I picked up Heroes on DVD, and watched it crazy fast. Great show; can’t wait for the second season.
*   Finally established a [Facebook][4] account. It’s like MySpace, but, much nicer.

I’m really quite embarrassed that I didn’t post anything last month. I think that’s the first month where I just completely missed updating at least once. I’m only mentioning this point because I’m cheating the timestamp, so that at least one post shows up.

I still have two larger events to talk about, but, I figure I’ll save those for another post. This post is pretty full now.
