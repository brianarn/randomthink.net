This is a picture of the heatsink that we pulled out of my stepdad’s old computer tonight in our attempt to clean and rebuild everything, so that Lisa has a fairly modern computer. Sorry for the poor picture quality, but my current digital camera is awful. The heatsink is composed of a series of metal prongs stinking up out of a big chunk of copper. The big brown blotches you see on the heatsink are clumps of dust that have gathered into much larger chunks. This is what was under the fan, and is probably the source of John’s heating problems.

I can’t believe how dirty that thing was. I’m now going to use the heatsink as a paperweight at work. It’s quite attractive for that purpose. I washed it down with soap to get the thermal grease off, and it’s good and fairly clean now. I didn’t use soap with the prongs, just hot water, and yet there is still some dirty heavily encrusted on the tops of the prongs. I’m going to have to see what I can do about that, or just leave it as memory.
