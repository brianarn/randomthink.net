Some time back, I recall Lisa telling me that she pulls up this picture when she needs a quick pick-me-up. It’s a picture we had taken out at her mom and dad’s house in Tijeras. I’ve since taken up the habit. It works well for me too. So, here you go. You can see it too.

Lily hasn’t really gotten much bigger, although her ears have more hints of silver now.
