Yeah, so [yesterday][1] I said that SimCity 4 was going to be my new addiction, and you could expect me to rant about that quite a bit. That will still be the case, but with another addiction.

Dance Dance Revolution is simply an awesome game. I’m so enjoying it. Seeing as I only have a PSX (not even a psOne, but a good ol’ PSX, prior to the dual shock one even), I went and picked up two dance pads and a copy of [Dance Dance Revolution Konamix][2]. I played against my friends Nasser and Anthony, and even though both of their women (as well as my wife) were there, none of the women would step on the pad. Anthony’s girlfriend finally did at one point, so that was neat, but that was also at like 11:30pm, after Nasser and his fiancée had left.

In instant messages now, my friend [Alex][3] said that his friend "lost tons of weight playing DDR over last summer." I can’t tell you how awesome that is to hear, as I could stand to drop a few pounds.

We had a nice little dinner party tonight. As stated above, Nasser and his fiancée and Anthony and his girlfriend stopped by, and we ate pizza and buffalo wings (like I said, I’m trying to lose weight) and played DDR Konamix a bit, then played a nice long game of Beyond Balderdash that I won. After that, a bit more Konamix, then we all were tired and everybody went home. It was truly an awesome, joyful evening.

So, expect to hear a lot more about DDR and SC4, as I’m hopefully going to get some time to play those in between classes this semester. I actually intend to use DDR as a workout plan. It has a Calorie Burning mode, where it counts calories burned during the workout. I think that’s just awesome.

Overall, today was really just a great day. I feel truly blessed to have the friends and family that I do. My wife is wonderful and beautiful, and friends like Anthony and Nasser are hard to find. I’m feeling really thankful to God right now. I hope your day was as good as mine.
